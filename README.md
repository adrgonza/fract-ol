## Introduction

Fract_ol is a fractal explorer program that allows users to visualize and interact with different types of fractals, such as the Mandelbrot set, Julia set, and Burning Ship fractal. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for navigating and zooming into fractal images, as well as customizing colors and rendering settings.

## Usage

To use fract-ol, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adrgonza/fract-ol.git
    ```

2. Build the program:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

3. Run Fract_ol with the desired fractal type:

    ```bash
    ./fractol [fractal_type]
    ```

    Replace `[fractal_type]` with the desired fractal type (e.g., `mandelbrot`, `julia`, `burningship`).

4. Use the arrow keys or mouse to navigate and zoom into the fractal image. Experiment with different rendering settings and colors to customize the visualization.

## Features

Fract_ol supports the following features:

- Rendering of various types of fractals (Mandelbrot set, Julia set, Burning Ship fractal)
- Real-time interaction and navigation within the fractal images
- Zooming and panning functionality using keyboard and mouse input
- Customizable colors and rendering settings for visual enhancement
- Multi-threading for parallel computation and performance optimization

## Building

To build Fract_ol, simply run:

```bash
make
```
